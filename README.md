## Project Title

GBDA302 Week 2 Example 3: Platforms (AABB Collisions)

---

## Authors

Karen Cochrane and David Han
Modifications: Giang Tran - Emotion & Mischief Mechanics

---

## Description

Adds several rectangular platforms. The blob is drawn as a noisy circle but collides using a simple axis-aligned bounding box (AABB). X and Y are resolved separately to keep behaviour predictable and teachable.

Modification: Redesigned to express Mischievous Panic emotion. The blob steals collectible items scattered across platforms, gaining speed and chaos with each theft while becoming increasingly anxious and jittery.

## Learning Goals

Learning Goals:

- Convert a circular sprite to an AABB for collision
- Implement overlap test and push-out resolution
- Manage grounded state only when landing on top faces

## Additional Learning (Modified Version)

- Express emotion through character animation and visual feedback
- Create escalating difficulty through consequence-based mechanics
- Implement dynamic environmental changes based on player actions

## Assets

N/A

## GenAI

The code was written by Dr. Karen Cochrane but she used GenAI to write the comments.

Modifications: The mischief mechanics and emotional animation system were developed by Giang Tran
